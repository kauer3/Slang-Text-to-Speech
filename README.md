## Description

  - #### Functionalities
    Slang reads out loud text from any website. It has a pop-up where it displays and updates the text while it's reading, and highlights the sentence being spoken synchronized with the speech, so that you can keep reading along regardless of the page you're on. Listening and reading simultaneously increases comprehension, strengthens memory, helps build fluency skills including proper phrasing and expression and improve sight word recognition!

  - #### How to use
    To make Slang speak, select the text you want to hear and hit the play button in the pop-up, or right-click the selected text and click speak.
    Through the pop-up you can choose from 21 voices in 14 languages and change it's volume, rate and pitch.
